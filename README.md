# frontend-studio

A [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) skill that builds tasteful, production-grade frontends with distinctive design — never AI slop.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add jonmagic/frontend-workflow
```

## What it does

Give it a brief ("build a landing page for a coffee roastery") and it:

1. Generates **3 distinct design directions** — each with a full palette, typography system, layout architecture, and hero technique
2. Serves a **visual mood board** on localhost so you can compare the options side-by-side with real fonts and color swatches
3. Builds the frontend using your chosen direction
4. Self-reviews against accessibility and quality rules before presenting output

Every generation produces a unique, handcrafted result. The same brief yields completely different designs each time.

## What's inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | The skill — decision framework, technique library, quality rules |
| `assets/mood-board-viewer.html` | HTML template for the visual mood board presentation |

The skill is not a component library or template. It's a **decision framework** — it teaches the agent how to make deliberate aesthetic choices, then execute them using a library of proven techniques.

## Example output

The framework has been validated across very different briefs:

- **DEADSTOCK** — dark sneaker e-commerce with organic 3D blob hero and neon volt accents
- **Sole Archive** — brutalist sneaker archive with 1px grid borders and faceted crystal hero
- **Stratos** — aviation simulator with wireframe terrain hero and HUD-style data panels
- **Axiom Labs** — physics research lab with particle network hero and editorial typography

Same skill, four completely different results.
